## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project, I enhanced my understanding of layout techniques using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Here's a code snippet showing how I aligned the four-card grid:


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}

```

 Also explored using media queries to create a mobile-first layout. Here's a sample of the media query I implemented for smaller screens:

```@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

Improving accessibility features like better screen reader support.
Further optimizing my CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts.
Exploring more advanced CSS animations for better user experience.
